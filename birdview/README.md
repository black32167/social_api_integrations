# Birdview
## Abstract
Birdview is a command-line tool enabling you to represent your work context in form of 
list of recently done (or planned) activities.

The tool also can try to group related activities together using 
[TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tfâ€“idf) - based approach to determine degree of relatedness between activities.

There are following types of activity item types supported:
 - jira tickets
 - trello cards
 - Github pull requests
